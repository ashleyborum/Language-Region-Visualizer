# Language Region Visualizer

Welcome to Language Region Visualizer! I am currently building this application because I was fascinated with spoken languages, and I wanted to visualize where they are spoken in a unique way. Feel free to view the shell I posted here and stay tuned as the build continues. View the Language Region Visualizer here! https://ashleyborum.github.io/Language-Region-Visualizer
